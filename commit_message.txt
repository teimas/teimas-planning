feat(testing): Implement comprehensive test suite for Planning Poker app

This commit adds a full test suite for the Planning Poker application, focusing on component, hooks, and store testing:

- Created test files for core components:
  - AnimatedPlanningCard
  - AnimatedParticipant
  - AnimatedResults
  - LanguageSelector

- Implemented basic tests for hooks:
  - useColorScheme (with coverage exclusion config)
  - useThemeColor

- Added initial tests for stores:
  - sessionStore (basic functionality)
  - Basic mocking for store interaction

- Set up testing infrastructure:
  - Created Jest configuration in package.json
  - Added global Jest setup files with proper mocks
  - Configured test exclusions and coverage reporting
  - Fixed issues with animation and React Native mocking

- Excluded simple re-exports from coverage reports
- Achieved 100% coverage for most component files
- Added snapshot tests for visual components

All tests now pass successfully with good coverage metrics for the core functionality.
