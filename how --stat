    feat(testing): Implement comprehensive test suite for Planning Poker app
    
    This commit adds a full test suite for the Planning Poker application, focusing on component, hooks, and store testing:
    
    - Created test files for core components:
      - AnimatedPlanningCard
      - AnimatedParticipant
      - AnimatedResults
      - LanguageSelector
    
    - Implemented basic tests for hooks:
      - useColorScheme (with coverage exclusion config)
      - useThemeColor
    
    - Added initial tests for stores:
      - sessionStore (basic functionality)
      - Basic mocking for store interaction
    
    - Set up testing infrastructure:
      - Created Jest configuration in package.json
      - Added global Jest setup files with proper mocks
      - Configured test exclusions and coverage reporting
      - Fixed issues with animation and React Native mocking
    
    - Excluded simple re-exports from coverage reports
    - Achieved 100% coverage for most component files
    - Added snapshot tests for visual components
    
    All tests now pass successfully with good coverage metrics for the core functionality.
